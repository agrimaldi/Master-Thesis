\f0\fs26 \cf0 Selenoproteins exist in all domains of life (prokaryotes, archaea and eukaryotes) However, it seems that higher plants and fungi have no selenoproteins. Yet, several photosynthetic microorganisms possess selenoproteins (about 10 have been found in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii \{Novoselov et al., 2002, EMBO J, 21, 3681\}, mainly peroxydases). Given the high nucleophilicity of Sec compared to Cys, many selenoproteins are in fact redox proteins, in which Sec is used to coordinate a redox- active metal (molybdenum, nickel or tungsten). Examples of selenoproteins are formate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase or thioredoxin reductase. Sec is then found almost exclusively in the catalytic sites of enzymes. It is interesting to note that a high number of selenoproteins have a homologue with Cys at the Sec position in other organisms \{Castellano et al., 2004, EMBO Rep, 5, 71-7\}, suggesting that not all organisms require selenium. The evolution of the Sec-encoding trait is subject to debate, but since this trait is present in organisms of the three domains of life, it is thought that the last universal common ancestor had this trait, which was subsequently lost in numerous lineages during evolution, and was regained by some lineages through gene transfer \{Zhang et al., 2006, Genome Biol, 7, R94\}. Furthermore, the scattered distribution of Sec containing homologues for a given family suggests that Sec incorporation is a \'93per family\'94 event.}
